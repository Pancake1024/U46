Shader Description
------------------
1) Car Paint Low Detail / Medium Detail / High Detail / Ultra

                          Low          Medium         High       Ultra
   Specular / Gloss        +             +             +           +
   Reflection              +             +             +           +
   Fresnel                 +             +             +           +
   Flakes                                +             +           +
   Up to 2 vertex lights                 +             +           +
   Up to 4 vertex lights                               +           +
   Self Shadowing                                                  +

2) Alpha Blending Shaders
   Like normal but with Diffuse Color Alpha value work as transparency - good for transparent parts (tail lights)

3) Glass Shaders
   Special formula shader for glass - also with texture support
   With Advanced Shader you can set Tint param and Alpha value - this will help you make more tinted windows (almost black for example)
  
4) Shader with Decals (only Medium and High for now)
   With additional texture work as decals (additional blend)
  
5) Shader with Reflection Mask
   Alpha of main texture is working as reflection mask (you can use one material per all model and just prepare another grayscale texture with reflection mask)

6) Shader with Reflection Mask & Color Mask
   Like 5) but non reflective parts of car are without diffuse color
  
7) Shader with Reflection Mask & Specular Mask
   Like 6) but also with Specular Masking  
  
8) Shaders with Probe Support
   No need to explain that
  
9) FakeHDR Shader
   Test shader - you can adjust dark parts of model to be more lightened
